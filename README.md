# UAS_Hackathon


Description:
Using drones to take photos of crops, the photos will the be processed internally to assess crop condition and decide which areas of the farms are healthy, and which are not. This information can then be used to fertilize areas of the crops that deamed to be not healthy.


Main Functions:

-Successfuly pilot the drone to all areas of the farm, which are predesignated
-Once in one of the predesignated spot, take a photo of the crops
-Using an image processor, determine whether the crops in the photo are healthy or not, based on a percetage of how similar the picture is to the model of a healthy crop picture.
-This result will then be sent back to the user to say if the crops in picture are healthy or not.


Main Benifits:

-Can give real time analysis on crop condition
-Inexpensive and time effecient to run
-Large market for it
-Reduces cost for the farmer as fertilizer only needs to be used in areas of need and not across the whole farm


What does this solve:

-To give an automactic assessment of areas of crops that are not healthy, this will then allow the farmer to fertilize the identified areas, and not waste fertilizer on areas of crops that do not need it.


Target user group:

-Individuals and companies that farm crops
-Companies that own and operate drones can use this an enter the market
